# python_web_scraping_ozon_rimzona
These are my first steps in cooking BeautifulSoup with requests/Selenium on python3.

I wanted to see how it works and find out which method works faster and more efficiently.
spoiler: requests and reading JSON responses lol

The url with the product cards that I used for an example:
-ozon: https://www.ozon.ru/seller/rz-accessories-127693/products/?miniapp=seller_127693
-rimzona: https://rimzona.ru

The following packages must be installed:
-bs4
-selenium
-webdriver-manager
-jsonl
-pickle
